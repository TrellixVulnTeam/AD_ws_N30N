ParseQueryAdapter

To display collections of data, we provide an implementation of Adapter in the Parse Android SDK. Instead of using a basic ListAdapter backed by a static array of objects, our ParseQueryAdapter provides a layer of abstraction and allows you to easily display data from one of your Parse classes in your AdapterView of choice (e.g. ListView or GridView).

To use a ParseQueryAdapter to display data in an Activity, follow the steps outlined below in your Activity's onCreate:

    Instantiate a ParseQueryAdapter.
    Customize it as necessary (see the below subsections for detailed instructions to display data from specific queries, change the UI of the Views to be displayed, and more).
    Set your new Adapter on your AdapterView with setAdapter().

When the AdapterView is attached to the window, your ParseQueryAdapter will automatically fetch the first set of data. This subclass simplifies the code that would otherwise be involved with:

    Pagination, with a row that can be tapped to load the next page.
    Configurable downloading and displaying of remote images within rows.
    Automatic loading and management of the Parse objects array.
    Callbacks from major events in the data cycle.

Consider the following code, which sets up a very simple ParseQueryAdapter to display data in a ListView. You can be up and running with a functional ListView full of data with very little configuration.

// Inside an Activity
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  // Uses a layout with a ListView (id: "listview"), which uses our Adapter.
  setContentView(R.layout.main);

  ParseQueryAdapter<ParseObject> adapter = new ParseQueryAdapter<ParseObject>(this, "Instrument");
  adapter.setTextKey("name");
  adapter.setImageKey("photo");

  ListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.listview);
  listView.setAdapter(adapter);
}
